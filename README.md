## What is it?
Monsterbrew is a tool to create or customize creatures statblocks for DnD 5th edition. You can create (homebrew) creatures from scratch or from an existing monster. My aim with this project is to provide an intuitive interface to homebrew your own content from scratch or from a template.

## Features
- Create a creature statblock from scratch
- Use an existing monster as a template
- Export your statblock to:
  - Homebrewery Markdown V3
  - JSON file in Open5e format
  - PDF
- Import an existing format via:
  - JSON (open5e format)
  - .monster files (tetra-cube)

## Upcoming features
- Monsterlist with complex filters
- Add environment tags to statblock
- Better support for Markdown in statblock (recognize attack and damage dice)
- Create auto difficulty feature (change stats based on CR)
- Add import / export options for Improved Initiative, Foundry, Roll20...

## Technology Stack
- NextJS 14
- Tailwind
- Plausible Analytics
- Sentry Error Monitoring
- Vercel Deployments
